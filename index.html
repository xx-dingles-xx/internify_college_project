            <h2>About Us:</h2>
            <p>We aim to provide an easy way for engineering college students to get a foothold in the workforce so they can have an easier 
                time, well, getting a job. We do that by providing projects from other companies and displaying them to the students, where 
                they can apply for internships for these projects, where they can gain real-world experience for their future employment!</p>
