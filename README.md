## Project Description
Internify is an online platform. It is a product of the "Connect" project. Our team wanted to create a website which would help students secure job and internships. And, we wanted companies to get the best employees.
Internify helps students develop skills which prepares them for their future jobs through opportunities present in Campus and other locations. It pairs up students within fields that they are interested in through recommendation based matching system. Students get paired up with mentors to help them learn and build skills throughout the process. Companies can post job opportunities for students to apply. The overall scale of this project helps in the development of proper skills before actual jobs
